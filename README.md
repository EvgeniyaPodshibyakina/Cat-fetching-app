# Flowbox-test-assignment

Objectives
<ul>
<li>Create a custom hook to fetch content (photos) from an API using Fetch AP (or mocking these calls with some predefined data).</li>
<li>Store data from API in a global state using Context API, Redux, MobX, Zustand, or whichever state management method you prefer.</li>
<li>Provide a way for the user to select the manner in which the content (photos) will be displayed (Grid, Carousel/Slider, list view and Cards). You donâ€™t need to do it manually, and using third-party library(ies) is totally fine.</li>
<li>User should be able to quickly change between these three different layout types</li>
<li>Be sure to include unit testing using any framework of your choice.</li>
<li>Create a github repo containing your app and share the link in an email once you have
completed the task.</li>
</ul>
