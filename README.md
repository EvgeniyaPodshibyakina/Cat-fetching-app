# Flowbox-test-assignment

Objectives
● Create a custom hook to fetch content (photos) from an API using Fetch AP (or mocking these calls with some predefined data).
● Store data from API in a global state using Context API, Redux, MobX, Zustand, or whichever state management method you prefer.
● Provide a way for the user to select the manner in which the content (photos) will be displayed (Grid, Carousel/Slider, list view and Cards). You don’t need to do it manually, and using third-party library(ies) is totally fine. See examples on the second page.
● User should be able to quickly change between these three different layout types
● Be sure to include unit testing using any framework of your choice.
● Create a github repo containing your app and share the link in an email once you have
completed the task.
